# Content
This folder contains 4 text documents from Medium Articles<br>
to run Summarization tests on them.<br>
## Purpose
LangChain Summarization Chain has 3 styles of application:
- map_reduce
- stuff
- refine
Summarization Pipeline instead use Transformers Library: the technique here<br>
consists in chunking, summarize the chunk with overlap, for the attention, and<br>
join the small Summarizations into one.
## Results
- PipeLine Summarization is excellent for a longer Summarization
- Langchain Summarization with refine style provide a more concise but precise Summarization, such as an abstract
